Mandates steelmanned distributions (≥2 primaries/side), five-valued classifications (IT/LF maps for user judgment), tool-verified chains. Reinforces safety: Grounded evidence, 'human decides' closes, no AI fiat. Optional lens—flag 'apply debias'; default neutrality. Prioritizes Truth/Love over Fear, empowering users without bias amplification.",
